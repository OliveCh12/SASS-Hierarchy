# SASS_Hierarchy

A SASS Boilerplate for scalabe project.

I made this repository, beacause, I'm tired recreate everytime a `scss file structure`

## How to use ?

You have to install "Sass" before unsing "SASS_Hierarchy". If you haven't done yet. Take a look over here : [Sass Installation](https://sass-lang.com/install "Sass Install")

### Install

Download the project by using git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OliveCh12/SASS-Hierarchy.git
```

Now you need to compile the content of `scss` directory into `css`

The command down below allows you to compile the scss in to css using the flag `--watch`. Everytime a file is modified, sass will compile.

```shell
sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.css
```

For compressed compilation use :

```shell
sass --watch scss/main.scss:css/main.minified.css --style compressed
```

Enjoy !
